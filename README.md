# enkf_benchmark

## Description
This is my personal data asimilation benchmark research code.  This includes code for developing and testing data assimilation schemes in the L96-s model.

## Structure
Dynamic model code for L96-s is included in the l96.py file.  Data assimilation methods are included in the ensemble_kalman_schemes.py file.  Drivers are in the benchmark files and submit for slurm scripts are pre-fixed with batch_submit.
